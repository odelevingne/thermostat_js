- You can increase the set point with the up button
- You can decrease the set point with the down button
- The minimum setpoint is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum setpoint is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum setpoint is 30 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the setpoint to 20 by clicking the reset button
- The thermostat colours the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red
